### Method 2: Local Development Install

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cursor-emulator.git
cd cursor-emulator
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

**Step 3: Configure MCP in IntelliJ IDEA**

**Option A: Using uvx (Recommended)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-emulator": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["."],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cursor-emulator",
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: Direct Python Execution**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-emulator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/cursor-emulator",
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 3: Docker Install

    "cursor-emulator": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "cursor-emulator", "python", "-m", "src.server"],
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Using uvx with Local Repositories

**Yes, `uvx` can install and run MCP servers from local repositories!** This is perfect for development and testing.

### How uvx Works with Local Repos

When you run `uvx .` in a local repository:

1. **Automatic Detection**: `uvx` detects the `pyproject.toml` file
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Downloads and installs all required dependencies
3. **Package Building**: Builds the package from source
4. **Execution**: Runs the package using the entry point defined in `pyproject.toml`

### Benefits of Using uvx Locally

‚úÖ **No Installation Required**: Runs directly from source code  
‚úÖ **Automatic Dependencies**: Handles all dependency management  
‚úÖ **Isolated Environment**: Creates clean virtual environment  
‚úÖ **Development Friendly**: Perfect for testing changes  
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows  

### Testing Your Local Setup

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd /path/to/cursor-emulator

# Test with uvx
uvx . --help

# The server should start and show the FastMCP banner
```

### Troubleshooting Local uvx Issues

**Issue**: "Command not found: uvx"
```bash
# Install uv first
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Issue**: Import errors or missing functions
```bash
# Clear uv cache to force rebuild
uv cache clean
uvx . --help
```

**Issue**: Dependencies not found
```bash
# Ensure pyproject.toml is properly configured
# Check that all dependencies are listed in [project.dependencies]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS` | Workspace directory path | Current working directory |
| `MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) | INFO |
| `MCP_TIMEOUT` | Tool execution timeout (seconds) | 30 |

### Advanced Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-emulator": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cursor-emulator"],
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS": "${workspaceRoot}",
        "MCP_LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG",
        "MCP_TIMEOUT": "60"
      },
      "timeout": 30000,
