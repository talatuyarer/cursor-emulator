# Cursor Emulator - Universal AI Code Assistant

## 🎯 Vision

**Transform any AI assistant into a powerful code assistant using local MCP server.**

Cursor Emulator is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that replicates all the advanced capabilities of Claude Code, making any AI assistant as powerful as the most advanced code assistants available.

## 🚀 The Problem

Most AI assistants are limited to basic text generation and lack the sophisticated tool integration needed for serious development work. They can't:

- Execute terminal commands or manage background processes
- Perform code analysis, linting, or semantic search
- Edit files atomically or manage complex file operations
- Access web search or GitHub integration
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Work with multiple tools in parallel

## 💡 The Solution

Cursor Emulator provides **complete tool parity** with Claude Code through a local MCP server, giving any AI assistant access to 19 advanced tools:

### 📋 Task Management Tools
- **TodoRead/TodoWrite**: Advanced task management with visual indicators, merge capabilities, and business rules
- **Visual Status Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators and priority management
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Tasks survive across IDE restarts and project switches

### 💻 Terminal & Process Management
- **RunTerminalCmd**: Shell command execution with background processes, environment variables, and streaming
- **GetBackgroundProcessStatus**: Monitor long-running processes
- **KillBackgroundProcess**: Terminate processes gracefully
- **ListBackgroundProcesses**: View all active background processes

### 🔍 Code Analysis & Quality
- **ReadLints**: Multi-language linting (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C++)
- **CodebaseSearch**: Semantic code understanding and exploration
- **Grep**: Pattern search using Linux grep command with comprehensive filtering

### 📝 File Operations
- **SearchReplace**: Exact string replacements with atomic writes
- **MultiEdit**: Atomic multi-edit operations (all-or-nothing)
- **DeleteFile**: Safe file deletion with validation
- **GlobFileSearch**: File discovery using glob patterns with Linux find command

### 🌐 Web & GitHub Integration
- **WebSearch**: Real-time web search with multiple engines and caching
- **FetchPullRequest**: GitHub pull request data retrieval
- **ApplyPatch**: Unified diff patch application using Linux patch command

### 🧠 Memory & Context Management
- **UpdateMemory**: Persistent memory management with tag-based organization, expiration, and access tracking

## 🎯 Universal Compatibility

Cursor Emulator works with **any AI assistant** that supports MCP:

- **Cursor**: Native MCP support
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Via Gemini Code Assist
- **Windsurf**: MCP integration
- **VS Code**: With MCP extensions
- **Any MCP-compatible IDE**: Universal protocol support

## ⚡ Performance Characteristics

- **Sub-millisecond Operations**: File operations and memory management
- **Parallel Execution**: 3-5x performance improvement for multiple operations
- **Local Processing**: No external API calls or network dependencies
- **Scalable**: Handles large codebases efficiently
- **Persistent Storage**: Cross-session context and memory

## 🔒 Security & Safety

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Commands restricted to workspace directory
- **Command Validation**: Whitelist of safe commands with dangerous command blocking
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing file operations prevent corruption
- **Process Isolation**: Background processes run independently
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error recovery

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Quick Install (No Setup Required)
```json
